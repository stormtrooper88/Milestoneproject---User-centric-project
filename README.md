User-Centric Frontend Development project - Code Institute – By Thomas Christian Butcher

The overview of the project "Full Stack Web Developer" is to create a website focused on demonstrating my skills as a Full Stack Web Developer. It aims to show to prospective employers the courses I that I have undertaken, those that I am yet to complete and some information about myself with finally a contact form if you wish to contact me. 

This is the link for the site: https://stormtrooper88.github.io/Milestoneproject---User-centric-project/

UX

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

My goal in the design of this site was to make it user-friendly to future employers whilst informing them about myself and what I have accomplished so far. The idea is to give the reader an outlook on who I am and what I have accomplished. The welcome caption with a contact me link allows the user to go directly to the contact form. The navbar allows the user to go through the site and return to parts they may not have seen. The next section is about me with a video containing someone typing to the right / left of the text about myself. The next section demonstrates what I have done so far regarding coding. Below this you will find a contact me form where you can complete it and I will receive the message. At the footer I have a link to my LinkedIn account. The greyscale colour scheme was chosen as it went well with my picture and created a silk look to the work. 

You can find my wireframes in my GitHub repository as I changed them throughout the project to ensure issues were fixed systematically.

Technologies
1.	HTML
2.	CSS

Features
This site uses the sticky navbar feature from bootstrap which does two things: firstly the nav-bar will follow the user down the page and secondly if you click on a certain section then you will directed to it immediately. I found this tool from the git repository in hschafer2017 (https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/StudentExampleProjectGradeFive) 

Features Left to Implement

I would like to have different languages in the menu bar as I speak French and Danish. 
I would also like to have fixed the background picture so it was not so focused and went along the middle of the page. 
I would also like to make sure that the work is functional on all platforms.

Testing


I have tested the links at the top of the page to ensure that they direct the user to that specific section of the site. 

I have tested the "contact me" button link to ensure that it takes the user to the contact form at the bottom of the page. 

I have gone to the "contact me" page and tried to submit without completing the name section. Upon clicking the send message button, a yellow mark pops up and states that the user must fill out the name section before being able to send the message. 
I have then filled in the name and left out the email. Upon clicking the send message button, a yellow mark pops up and states that the user must fill out the name section before being able to send the message. I have also tested inputting a random set of letters into the email section and then receive a notice stating that the @ is missing from the email section. I have tried simply entering the @ however I am told I must enter a part after the @. 
Once I have filled in both the name and email section of the form, I am told that my message won't send until a message has been written. 
With all the information filled in, the page reloads and the contact me form is blank again. 



I am currently having trouble with my video being loaded onto the page. This is video is a welcome message and so should be seen regularly. – This has since been resolved but now the video isn’t playing. I have spoken to my mentor and though we tried to fix the issue with embedding the link in google documents it was not fixed and so I have decided to create a carousel with a fade. This however is not showing up on the site right now. 

I have had problems moving my nav bar to the middle which through watching videos on how to edit this I was able to change it. (insert link)
I cannot seem to place my footer at the bottom and middle of the page. - I have since been able to fix this issue and now have the footer at the middle bottom of the page. 

The links I have in my footer are not linking with their respective sites. This was fixed after noticing that my links did not have https in them. 

I have had issues with the "about me" section and positioning it correctly. I have since placed it just above the carousel so that it can be clearly read and seen by the user. 

Deployment

This is the link for the site: https://stormtrooper88.github.io/Milestoneproject---User-centric-project/

I created the GitHub Pages site following the instructions laid out on the GitHub site. 

I did this by entering my GitHub repository and entering the settings section. From here I went down to GitHub Pages section and choose the theme "minimal". From here I then directed to the settings page of my repository and in the Github Pages section I found the below link to my site. 

If you wish to run the code locally then you can clone my git repository and run it on AWS cloud 9.
